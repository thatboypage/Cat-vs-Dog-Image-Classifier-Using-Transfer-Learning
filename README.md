# Cat-vs-Dog-Image-Classifier-Using-Transfer-Learning
This project uses transfer learning with the InceptionV3 architecture to classify images as either a cat or a dog. The model was fine-tuned on a labeled dataset and achieved 98% validation accuracy. It includes data preprocessing, model training, image prediction, and a simple interface for uploading and testing new images in real time.
